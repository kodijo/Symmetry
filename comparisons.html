					<h2 id="Classic Religions">Classic Religions and Their Value</h2>
					<p>
						Classic religions have lost their influence on the modern world due to their inability to compete with science as a rhetoric that improves people’s lives.  
						However, completely losing religiosity is like losing a leg; the atrophied leg may eventually be forgotten, but you will lose its power to carry you.  
						Religion has the ability to powerfully and positively change people’s lives by providing a comprehensive structure for experiencing reality and creating the structure needed for moving on, 
						especially during difficult times.  Science cannot offer this meaning to us fully due to the perpetual lack of ‘sufficient’ information and understanding.  
						Symmetry is an attempt to bridge this gap by allowing for a logical development of purpose driven from the practical experiences of being human.  
						By identifying and isolating effective practices and tying them to understandable, reliable sources of truth, the opportunity to satisfy both demands arises.

					</p>

					<p>
						
						Having religion in one's life is an extremely strong motivator and creator of purpose. 
						The reaction of modern society to religious extremism is atheism, but fighting doctrine with silence never works. 
						This is an opportunity to create a more meaningful doctrine. Or multiple doctrines, as there are crypto assets. 
						These doctrines will exist as a response to all other doctrines that do not focus on the individual and cannot tailor themselves to each person's needs. 
						They need the basis, the platform to develop organically and systematically. 
						They need to be a response to the doctrines that "sort of" work, as well as the state of mind that that sort of existence is sufficient, 
						that we should not or cannot ascend each of us to epiphany, to enlightenment, but not as a stroke of luck or through ritualistic self sacrifice but through consistent, 
						deliberate, structured intention translated into action.

					</p>

					<h3> Monotheism</h3>

					The concept of a single, perfect being from whose image we are made fits the idealization point; 
					ultimate intention and power is the goal of symmetry, as is ‘godliness’ as character exhibited by people.  
					“Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself” is an iconic example of symmetry, but this statement can be unpacked in a more sophisticated way; 
					be aware that the impact of yourself on others (actions taken in the present, perceived linearly in time) will have higher order impacts of others onto you (t^2, t^3, etc), so choose a strategy of interacting with others.
					After applying an individualistic decision model and game theory, we can see that value of potential long term value of positive external efforts. 

					<h2 id="Modern Religions">Modern Religions</h2>
					<p>
						Modern religions attempt to sway followers in different ways: <br>
						Scientology use a combination of techniques that improve quality of life, combined with a confusing doctrine and power hierarchy.
						Other modern cults use group dynamics, dramatic lifestyle changes and hypnotic inculcation.
						Regardless of the efficacy of these movements, the social need for religion is apparent, but the mental divide is clear as well:  
						the classic doctrines do not fit the modern logical mind, but the need for higher purpose remains.

					</p>
					<h3> Scientology </h3>

					<h4> Clear </h4>
					<p> Becoming clear is akin to achieving enlightenment or symmetry. Exercises in symmetry are a popular tool.</p>


					<h3> New Thought</h3>
					<p>
						
						Recognition of intention as the primary driving force and its reverberating impact. 
						Symmetry does not claim that a good intention leads to any desired result, such as improved health and well being. 
						Personal intention is just one of the waves that impacts health and a person’s overall state. 
						Its power is simply because it is entirely in the hands of its creator.

					</p>

					<h2> Buddhism</h2>
					<p>
						Buddhist enlightenment is the creation of an internal soliton. 
						It supersedes feelings and desires and it moves your identity to a deeper plane where those waves can’t affect it. 
						The symmetry created in the process is extremely powerful, as we see what monks are capable of- from calm self immolation to unnaturally long preservation after death. 
						However, in the context of our framework, this is only half of the picture. No amount of internal symmetry will change the world. 
						Intention is needed for that. And while it may seem contradictory, the duality of maintaining enlightened symmetry and creating ever more complicated structure are not mutually exclusive. 
						For example, monks need to eat. They must satisfy that desire to live. In fulfilling that desire, they challenge themselves to keep their symmetric identity whole. 
						They create structures that relate that desire to their (mostly) unwavering identity, such as only eating the bare minimum needed to survive, as do other ascetic practices. 
						However they wish to minimize this structure, it is there. 
						Our contention is that there are other desires worth satisfying, as long as we strive to fulfill the competing goals of purity of intention and efficacy in structural development.

					<h3> Wolfram's Cellular Automata</h3>
					<p> 
						Wolfram's general approach to generative universes based on simple rules and repetitive application of (an) operator(s) to develop the state of the system is in agreement with this framework.

					</p>

					<h3> Cognitive Theoretic Model (CTMU) </h3>

					<h4>Comprehensibility and Utility</h4> 
					<p>
						A basic difference between the frameworks is that CTMU does not offer a clear description of reality to a lay-person and it does not offer much practical advice on how to live life.
						Our assumption is that any good framework for reality should have derivations that can be actively applied to improve your life.
					</p>
					<h4> CTMU Axioms </h4>

					<p>
						Here we compare the three CTMU axioms with the three of Symmetry:

						<ul style="margin-left: 40px">
							<li>
								&bull;	 MAP (Metaphysical Autology Principle) states there is nothing external to reality. 
							</li>

							There is a difference between the two frameworks on this point.  Langan argues that were reality to have an external creator, the creator would need to be real.
							However, if we consider the possibility that we are in a simulation, which cannot be countered by observation, we can imagine a creator outside of the simulation.
							While it can be argued that both us and the creator are part of a joined reality, we really don't know what if anything is happening outside of our observable experience,
							and more fundamentally, we cannot break through that barrier as that would require having access to degrees of freedom outside of our 'reality'.
							A more narrow interpretation of this principle can be considered analogous to saying, "we cannot experience anything outside of what we call reality."  
							If we apply Symmetry's 1st axiom on the wavy nature of our experience, this is saying the same thing-
							we cannot experience anything outside of the wavy framework that we live in.

							<li>						
								&bull;	M=R (Mind Equals Reality Principle)
							</li>

							This principle says that our experience of reality is inseparable from reality itself.  This can be considered a combination of the first two of Symmetry's axioms-
							Since we are waves that were generated from an initial wave, the reality that we experience and ourselves resonate on the same fundamental structures.  
							Our finite-dimensional experience of reality is an interface between the localized contained waves of the "I" and the rest of reality.

							<li>						
								&bull;	MU (Multiplex Unity)
							</li>

							This principle says that reality is consistent in our experience as it stems from a singular 'essential medium'.  
							This is consistent with Symmetry's axioms 1 and 3, whereby reality is generated from a symmetric beginning and all waves are contained in the subsequent generative process.    
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h4> UBT (unbound telesis) </h4>
					<p>
						This is just the symmetric underlying structure to reality.  No more meaning is assigned to it in our framework since we have no way of interacting with it.
					</p>
