						I do not accept any modern doctrine as the 'truth about the world'.  Modern philosophy has become either detached from real life or a collection of practical advice.
						Existing religions are either outdated and incompatible with science, or are not sufficiently compelling.  

						This is a framework for living life. It is rooted in science and logic, with derivations and extrapolations that resonate intuitively and emotionally.  It should be:

					</p>
					<ul style="margin-left: 40px">
						<li>
							&bull;	Consistent with my experience and self-consistent

					<h2 id="GSummary">General Summary</h2>


						<p>
							Our ability to experience necessitates change, and constant change means there is always something new being added to our experience.
							We make sense of this experience based on repetitions. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything is wavy and waves interacting with each other create additional dimensions.  If waves resonate with each other they create structure. 
							This pattern of simple structures building into more complicated ones is the fundamental driving force in our universe. 
							Humans are the most complicated structures in the universe by this definition but we have the capacity to not only enhance our own structure with technology, 
							we may eventually create stand-alone structures of greater complexity than ourselves. 
							So the point of the universe, and particularly our place in it, is to create that next level of structure.
						</p>
						<p>
							While that may be the purpose of the universe and humanity at large, it doesn’t have to be an individual’s purpose. 
						There’s no denying that by and large, humanity is working very hard to achieve this goal and society rewards this behavior.
						Yet every individual is unique- a combination of predetermined potential and experiences that fill that capacity. 
						Generally, an individual’s capacity for experience is left largely untapped, and we tend to narrow our range of experiences with age. 
						We do not know our bodies, in terms of awareness as well as capacity for performance. 
						Likewise our minds and ability to interact effectively with the external world are limited. 
						They are limited because the dimensionality of an individual does not fit in nicely with society, and progress (subsequent resonance-driven structural density). 
						Historically the variations of people that could contribute meaningfully to the continuation of structural development was limited, 
						so many children died and a narrow gene pool persisted but we are experiencing a dimensional boom where the vanishing struggle for survival allows those who were traditionally unfit to flourish. 
						The amount of routine activities that people must perform is constantly decreasing, allowing us to create structural density at an exponentially increasing rate.
						</p>
						<p>
						Happiness comes from jumping into this stream and creating persistent structures of your own. 
						The more you make, the happier you’ll be! There are logical ways to go about doing this that are discussed. 
						One key is that for structure to persist it must be repeated and supported, meaning it’s easier to do it in a group. 
						Try to find something you can be a part of, and if nothing fits, figure out how you can create your own version. 
						You might be surprised by who else it resonates with. 
						Regardless, greatest happiness and maximal structural density occur together when all aspects of life are involved. 
						We are omnivores, we can experience such a wondrous range of sights, sounds, smells and thoughts that by combining these things together is where we find our peaks. 
						Sadly, as waves we can’t maintain peak intensities. Our search for happiness is a search for continual structural compactification that will allow us to reach a higher peak in the next cycle. 
						There is no guarantee that any dimensional set that we are currently exploring will allow for significant compactification, ie will resonate with the external world, 
						so we must maintain a basis that covers the entire range of our experiential abilities.	
						</p>
						<p>
						For any choice of intention, or goal, there is an optimal solution for how to approach achieving that goal given the degrees of freedom in our control and the shape of the phase space around us.
						We need goals and direction to thrive, yet neglecting the parts of ourselves that are not primarily responsible for that goal is counter-productive, as they still contribute meaningfully.
						We assert that the right approach to goal seeking is a wave, with the peak focused around our intention, and a symmetric dissipation around the related degrees of freedom.
						The optimal shape of the wave is considered - too shallow and we risk flat-lining, too steep and we risk a discontinuous break.
						</p>
						
						 
						 
						 
						
					
					<h2 id="Axioms">Framework Axioms</h2>
					
					<h3>Wavy nature</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Assumption 1 - Our experience of the universe is wavy.</b>
						Our current best descriptions of the universe are variants of String Theory.  
						It is possible that String Theory is the limit of human ability to express its understanding of the world, as simply the limit of how we are able to experience it.  
						Therefore the theory may say as much about people as it does nature.    
						Our sense of permanence is accomplished by solitons. Solitons, or perfectly repeating waves, form the basis of our experience.
					</p>

					

					<h3>Degrees of Freedom and Phase Space</h3>
					<p>
						
						<b>Assumption 2- Our ability to experience and interact with the world can be decomposed into a finite set of dimensions.<a href="/Symmetry/notes.html#dof"><sup>2</sup>></a></b>  
						There are experiential dimensions for vision, such as up, down, dark, bright, or far and yellow.  
						There are the dimensions for thought, which is a combination of repetitions of past experiences.
						They can be the options for action, like raising a hand or uttering a sound. 
						Let’s call the space of all possible dimensions phase space.  
						At any time we are little waves repeating themselves in small sections of phase space, akin to inhabitants of Conway’s Game of Life.

					</p>
					<h3>Generation axiom</h3>
					<p>

					</p>
					 <b>
						Assumption 3 -  Every wave interacts independently with a 'source' to create new dimensions. </b>
						<i> Note: this axiom is unverified speculation and needs refinement.  </i>
						The imaginary constant in the time evolution of any quantum system has a simple interpretation- 
						that a new degree of freedom is created in the evolving system which cannot be directly experienced via interaction with the original basis. 
						Any interaction will be a projection on a lower dimensional space which is the measurement paradox. 
						The main difference between a single system evolving in isolation versus a couple that are intertwining (entangling) is that the couple can experience the creation of these new degrees of freedom together without the necessity for collapse. 
						A dream shared becomes real. Every quantum system (distinct wave) is evolving within itself through interaction with some operator.
						Since we cannot distinguish from our perspective the effect of this operator from the evolution of time, we can call it time evolution.  
						The size of the imaginary dimensional space created is proportional to the complexity of the originating system. 
						Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon of quantum mechanics via the generation axiom.
					
					
					<h2> Structure and Entropy</h2>
					<h3>Symmetry Breaking and Fixed Points</h3>
					<p>
						Upon release of initial conditions, ie the big bang, there was no meaningful structure in the universe as it was by all indications perfectly symmetric.  
						Over time, the symmetry collapsed and in its wake structures emerged.  Let’s call structure repeating oscillations in phase space.  
						Structure exists because waves tend to repeat themselves after they are created.  
						Each time symmetry breaks, we can imagine a string being held down at a particular point.
						On a stringed musical instrument, holding the string at various points will create different notes.
						Each symmetry break creates structure and we will call it a fixed point.
						Structures such as particles, light, then atoms, molecules, stars, and eventually people and the idea of singularity.  
						The tendency of structure in the universe as it relates to evolution is always increasing complexity of structure or information density.  
						So what we see as evolution is the coalescence of simple structures into complex ones and can be a measure of the acceleration in structural density.
					</p>


					<h3>The Bowl</h3>
					<p>
						The tendency of our entire observable universe to move in the direction of increased entropy lies in contrast with the series of extremely unlikely events that created ourselves.  
						When we consider the phase space of our universe as a whole, if we put a randomly oscillating wave into that phase space (eg initial condition like the big bang),we have two choices when considering its evolution:
					</p>
					<ul style="margin-left: 40px">
						<li>
							&bull;	The shape of the phase space is fixed, or predetermined 
						</li>
						<li>						
							&bull;	The shape of the phase space evolves over time
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Let's call the shape of the phase space The Bowl.  
						The bowl is a convenient mental image because of the following point: 
						Whereas the rest of the universe is undergoing fairly random chaos, our local region is becoming more and more coherent and orderly.  
						There is a tendency in nature to fall into ruts of efficiency, such as the forming of stars, the forming of molecules, the evolution of those molecules into self-replicating structures.  
						While every single event leading to our existence was random, in retrospect there is no denying that the universe is trending towards something.  
						That something let’s call the bottom of the bowl.  
						Just as unavoidably as a marble placed anywhere in it will end up rolling down the side of a bowl and will reach the bottom, 
						so will a universe full of random chaos eventually explore the depths of its phase space bowl.

					</p>

					<h3>The Bottom of The Bowl</h3>
					<p>
						What is at the bottom of this phase space?  
						If we look at evolution before and through ourselves, the pattern that emerges is one of structures that lead to the creation of new degrees of freedom. 
						Ape NFTs or metaverse gear has no meaningful implication in the “physical” world. 
						As the information density continues to increase degrees of freedom, humanity will have no choice but to interface more directly with technology to keep up. 
						What happens when structural density begins to approach its asymptote?
						Is the bottom of the bowl just the start of a new one?
					</p>




					<h2 id="Self">Applying the Framework to Ourselves</h2>
					<h3> The First Three Zones of Waves</h3>
					<ul style="margin-left: 40px">
						<li>
							&bull;	Inputs
						</li>
						<li>						
							&bull;	Internal
						</li>
						<li>						
							&bull;	Outputs
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These three zones can be considered analogous to the inputs, outputs and the model for a neural network.
						There are a number of difference with the analogy, primarily that the model for a neural network to date does not constantly evolve in time.
						Second, that the input and output parameter spaces are generally the same for a neural network: list of tokens in, list of tokens out.
						The vector space of possible tokens is the same, with only lengths varying from model to model unless they are domain specific, such as text-to-image.
						For humans, the input vector space is completely separated from the output space:  
						Our sensory organs are not also responsible for initiating movement.

					</p>

					<h3> Free will and determinism </h3>
					<p>
						Based on the idea of the Bowl- In this perspective free will and determinism are not incompatible. 
						We can choose our individual actions but the universe's resonance structure is predetermined.
						Depending on your local phase space, you may not have any choice at all because the cost to defying the shape is greater than your intention.

					</p>
					
					<h3>Bases</h3>
					<p>
						No person is able to hold within themselves all of the waves they have ever experienced, so we choose our priorities.
						We may forget details about history, or math, or other people's names as non-essential.
						Other information we hold onto dearly our whole lives.
						We repeat that which we consider important, and these structures create our internal world view.
						When we go through life, or perform any particular task, there as a set of dimensions that we pay attention to.
						When driving a car, this could be the two lanes on either side of the car along with what's in front of us and what is visible through the mirrors.
						People are not capable of focusing on more than one thing at a time, so our experience is a combination of different dimensions that we pay attention to,
						and we may transition through different combinations of dimensions in a structured way as part of performing a particular activity.
						Each combination of dimensions that occupy our experience we will call a state, and the set of states that we oscillate through regularly we will call our <em>basis</em>.
						
					</p>
					
					<h3>The First State - Singularity</h3>
					
					<p>
						There’s a lot of talk about enlightenment, the power of now, the loss of ego, etc.  
						What they have in common is a very personal experience of the world and our place in it.  
						Generally speaking, in these states there is a loss of differentiation between ‘me’ and ‘not me’.  
						When we are born, we are automatically in this state, since the ‘me’ has not been created yet.  
						Many people spend a lot of time trying to get back to this state and to hold it for as long as they can, believing it is the ‘solution’ to living life, or that some extra secrets lay there.
						While the singular state is a trivial solution, it is compatible with any basis, as a basis can be reduced to a singularity.  
						Therefore the first method for basis transition is derived- By first reaching singularity, and then expanding degrees of freedom into the new basis.
					</p>

					<p>
						This state is available to you right now and it feels perfectly freeing. 
						It feels as though all of the burdens of the world have been lifted from your shoulders. 
						Your breath is light, your mind at ease and in a state of wonder. 
						This is the redemption you are seeking- the forgiveness of your sins of excess. 
						The identity does not offer any answers, only relief. 
						But for the overburdened, relief is the answer. 
						Tap into this power and free yourself.
						And from there, your previous goals will seem easier, closer. You will have more power to reach for them.
					</p>


					<h3>The First Basis - Duality</h3>
					
					<p>
						Our first and most basic contrast can be pleasure and pain, 'me' and 'not me', good and bad, love and hate.  
						At some point after we are born, the symmetry of our experience collapses into one of these bifurcations.
						We are built to seek pleasure and avoid pain, yet clearly that is not the sole driver of humanity.
						However the symmetry breaks, a fixed point is created.
					</p>

					<p>
						After the first duality, we quickly realize there are more degrees of freedom in the world, even through simply the modulation of the primary duality.
						From then on, our bases tend to get more and more complicated with time.
						Maintaining a basis internally requires internal tension.  The more complicated the basis, the more difficult to maintain and operate in.
						Compare scratching a particular spot on yourself while looking directly at it, or by looking at it through a mirror.
						We recognize the competing forces of basis simplification and utility.  Evaluation of basis utility will be discussed elsewhere.
					</p>

					<h4> Choosing your fundamental duality - Intention and Symmetry</h4>

					<p>
						The basis used for generating this work is one of intention and symmetry.  The two competing forces are of creation and balance.
						They are not necessarily the most fundamental but they are useful as a framework for perspective on life.
						Whatever basis you choose for life, try to be aware of what it is and why you are choosing it.
						Realize that you have a choice in the matter and that choice will affect how you experience everything else.
					</p>

					<h3>Our Fixed Points</h3>
					
					<p>
						Everyone shares some of the same fixed points, as we share some of the same DNA.  
						On top of that set of fixed points, humans vary not only in general physiology but also in the mental states we occupy.
						Everyone creates fixed points for themselves in their routines and beliefs.  Your world view is a set of fixed points. 
						That belief can change over time, but at any single point in time we have a single world view, a singular experience of reality.
						We are masters of our experience and we can change it with tools ranging from meditation to self-hypnosis to drug induced hallucinations.
						All of these tools release some of the fixed points that were previously held while creating new ones, allowing us greater perspective to gaze more freely into the vastness of experience.
						Some of these changes stay with us, while others require regular repetition.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly, society is a combination of fixed points.  Laws and codes of ethics are prime examples.  
						Societies works because these fixed points are adhered to by the vast majority - creating stable solitons in what would otherwise be anarchy.
					</p>

					<h3>Goals - Intention and Optimization</h3>
					
					<p>
						We are constantly under pressure.  There is pressure within us, from hunger pangs and muscle aches to desires.
						Similarly, there are external pressures, from gravity and light to societal expectations.  
						In spite of society's progress, humans overall are under more pressure now than they were in the past.
						If anything, humans are working harder than ever before, they are absorbing much more information than before, and are interacting with
						many more degrees of freedom than ever before.  
					</p>

					<h4> Intentionality </h4>
					<p> 
						This is a familiar word that generally means purpose.  
						In the context of this framework we consider intentionality as the sum of the accumulated structural density in a localized area.
						Because the underlying force to the evolution in the universe is structural compactification, 
						we can extrapolate the asymptotic regime for any wave group to either convergent or divergent structure based on the shape of the surrounding phase space.
						For example, I could want two contradictory things.  
						In this case, my internal structure will diverge asymptotically and eventually dissipate instead of compactifying.
						If my desire is aligned to the shape of the space around me, it will become trivially easy for me to accomplish.
						For example, if my goal was to give away all of my money, I could easily accomplish this as our current world is dominated by scarcity.
					</p>
					<p>
						So intention is the net sum of our internal tensions or fixed points - all of those waves that made their way inside of us and somehow stayed there, resonating.
						Some may cancel each other out - our intermittent desires for doing something against the law is counteracted by the desire to stay out of trouble.
						The ones that do not cancel out move us - some inspire us, others scare us, but all of them cause us to think, feel or to act.
					</p>

					<p> 
						These internal and external pressures may be increasing but an average person's capacity for maintaining pressure does not (upon reaching adulthood).
						Cognitive load theory tell us there is only so much we can process and store at any given time.  
						Therefore for a given cognitive capacity, optimizing cognitive load against goals or intention means reducing unnecessary load.
						Since cognition is wave-like, the more time we spend thinking about something, the deeper we can think into the subject.
						This implies that an optimal cognitive load will have a minimum of distractions and interruptions.
						Social media, physical desires and natural daily cycles are all factors that can affect our ability to focus.
						Time your rituals such as sleeping, eating, exercising and socializing to synergistically enhance your goals.
						For that, understand your needs and wants in all categories and the effect of those needs and wants on each other and on your goals:
						Your need for socialization may interfere with your want for actualization when you spend too much time socializing.
						Or your desire for sweets may interfere with your energy cycle and prevent you from maintaining a focused state for enough time to complete complex tasks.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finding the balance between all internal and external forces is the crux of life.  
						Choose to let in the ones that do- and release the ones that do not- drive you towards a more symmetric intention.
						If you want to be rich, consider how you can make all those around you richer - or you may find yourself poor in all but your bank account.
					</p>
					
					

					<h4> Choosing your Fixed Points</h4>

					<p>
						Modern society is rapidly progressing towards greater individual freedoms, and analogously, a change in fixed points for every person.
						From being slaves to our need for survival, to being slaves to others, we have evolved to the point where we can choose our own career as easily as our own gender.
						The dominant giving into the submissive completed my oscillation in the dimension around gender, releasing my fixed point on sexual identity. 
						Now I oscillate freely around my intention. Do I need to adhere to traditions or labels?
						It depends on what I am seeking- the more particular the intention, the more defined the phase space of possible solutions. 
						A state that does not fit my intention isn’t bad intrinsically, it is bad because of the mismatch. 
					</p>

					<h4> The Argument for Plenty </h4>
					
					<p>
						The developments in human society over the last 50 years may appear to represent stagnation in our general development.
						No significant progress in space exploration or efficient energy sources - no flying cars.  
						No room temperature ambient pressure superconductors either.
						Yet the percentage of the human race that is no longer starving and that is connected to each other through the internet is skyrocketing.
						Often an invisible foundation must be built before the next level of progress can be achieved.  
						Just as an athlete must train the supporting muscles and other bodily systems before they can break through a plateau,
						so must we move to create robust connections where there are thin ones, move towards inclusivity from exclusivity, stability from instability,
						and a win-win mindset over a win-lose one.
						This is currently the stage of development that humanity is moving through - a general transition from scarcity to plenty.
						Apparently our technological and socio-cognitive progress has expanded into an area of phase space that is very vast.
						It will need to be filled substantially before we can proceed to the next level.
						
					</p>
					
					<h3> Purification</h3>

					<p>
						A lot can be said on the value of purity.  In the context of this work, purity is defined as a singular intention.
						How can we take all of the disparate fixed points that have accumulated inside of us and turn them into one?
						This is the defining characteristic of religion - a single fixed point which encompasses all of reality and our experience.
						Living without a singular purpose is by definition less human than otherwise, since as humans we define ourselves singularly - with 'I'.
						If your identity is scattered across multiple competing fixed points, your sense of self will crumble.
						Similarly, be careful of the primary purpose you choose.  Heroin is very compelling for addicts and seeking it can become their primary intention.
						Remember that creating structure across new degrees of freedom is our purpose.
					</p>

					

					<h4> Closing Loops</h4>
					<p>
						Aside from choosing good fixed points, closing loops is the best way to purify your state.  
						Minimizing repetitive closed loops is an optimization feature of life.
						Though we may derive pleasure from a multitude of activities and experiences, it is only those which enable us to reach higher peaks that must be considered essential.
						If you have too many things going on in your life, you will be distributing your intention among competing dimensions, and your peak across your primary intention will be lower.
						The more loops you close that are not supporting of your primary intention, the easier and more fulfilling your life will become.  
						
					</p>

					<h4> Avoid prolonged static tension</h4>
					
					<p>
						Static tension is a wave that does not oscillate, or rather oscillates tightly due to constraints. 
						The closer to pure intention, the more static tension can be maintained. 
						An impure identity repeated will cause surrounding dissipation as extra effort will be required to maintain the wave. 
						Pure intention that resonates with you and your surroundings will become effortless to maintain. 
						This highlighted the difference between good and bad- the effort required to perpetuate. 
						If you need to force things to maintain a state, it is not meant to be. If the state comes naturally, embrace it.
					</p>
					<p>
						As we live, our intention may change.  New opportunities and changing circumstances may reshape our internal phase space and reorient our internal basis.
						Sometimes we know that our basis needs to change as our intention has changed, but we do not know how to change our basis to accommodate.
						The goal of this work is two-fold.    
					</p>
					<ul style="margin-left: 40px">
						<li>
							&bull;	One is to help create a reliable 'common' basis, or a core set of dimensions that remain largely unchanged regardless of who you are or your circumstances.
						</li>
						<li>						
							&bull;	The second is to help find the optimal way of changing the 'personal' basis to accommodate your current situation and personal experience.  
						</li>
					</ul>



					<h3>The Primary Intention</h3>
					<p>
					
						The easiest purpose to choose is to go with the stream of the universe.
						Acknowledge that the universe has purpose and participate in that purpose. 
						The purpose, as discussed previously, is to help develop the next level of structural compactification. 
						This is still a very general statement but any person is put into a specific set of initial conditions by the time they read this. 
						You may be an experienced coder, soccer player, or carpenter. 
						Whatever basis you exist in and whichever degrees of freedom your life focuses on, the future state of humanity will continue to appreciate a version of those skills. 
						Find opportunities to further hone those skills and share them with others. How can you help ten people eat a healthy delicious meal more easily? A hundred? A million?
					</p>
					
					<h3>Symmetry - the Solution Approach</h3>
					
					<p>
						The main assertion of this work is that the solution to any intention is a symmetric basis.  
						What this means is that given a set of internal pressures, there is a set of degrees of freedom available to the person that will provide the optimal outlet.
						The optimal solution is a reorientation of the personal basis until a symmetric expression of that intention across the basis is achieved.
					</p>

					<h3> Three Zones of Waves</h3>

					<p>
						We break the human experience into three zones:
						<ul style="margin-left: 40px">
							<li>
								&bull; Low frequency waves that correspond to the unconscious.
							</li>
							<li>						
								&bull;	High frequency waves that correspond to the conscious.
							</li>
							<li>						
								&bull;	Intermediate zone of overlap between the conscious and unconscious.
							</li>
						</ul>

							This striation is useful because by identifying the intermediate zone we can gain greater control over ourselves.
							The boundary of the intermediate zone is our intention.  
							We consider the focal point of the intermediate zone the breath. 
							
					</p>
					<h4> Breath </h4>

						Physiologically, the breath is uniquely controlled by conscious and unconscious muscles.
						By learning to control and to give up control of our breath, we gain control of our most basic structural building block.
						We gain awareness into the subconscious forces that guide us and the conscious actions that we create.
						Every other structure that create will be dependent on how we breathe, either directly or indirectly.
						Qi Gong, pranayama, Vin Hoff as examples of techniques for intentious breathing as healthy for the body.  
						All focus on balance of breath in the body, and the balance of the pressures of the breath.

					<h2 id="Exercises">Exercises with Symmetry</h2>
					<h3>Static symmetry</h3>
					
					<p> 
						There are popular practices for symmetrization of tension for relief of everything from physical to mentail ails.
						The popularity confirms the efficacy of these methods.
						As a raindrop achieves a symmetric form naturally to balance itself against the external forces, so a person must actively find symmetry.
						Start with identifying a point of tension in your body.  
						Then become aware of the opposite point in the left-right symmetry (for example, your left shoulder if your right shoulder is tense).
						Is it more or less tense?  First simply become aware of the opposite area.  
						Try to balance the sensations simply by thinking about them, without movement.
						Then move one side, then the other, to see if you can't bring them to a more similar state of sensation.
					</p>

					<p>
						After left-right symmetry, consider local symmetry.  In other words, the areas around your point of tension.
						Are the areas near your tension also tense?  How far does your awareness need to travel to find relaxation?
						Practice moving your focus around the areas of tension and non-tension, trying to even them out.
						Then, move the tense and relaxed areas, to see if you can't bring them to a more similar state.
					</p>

					<p>
						These exercises do not only need to be for strictly physical sensations.  
						For mental sensations, one realization is that each mental sensation is associated to a physical one.
						It may be the faintest feeling, but we may tense an area, or move our eyes, when thinking about particular subjects.
						Those physical acts act as anchors for our mental states.  
						By becoming aware of these relations, we unlock greater potential for control over them.
					</p>

					<p>
						Moving into the states of the mind, symmetry can be achieved just as well - mental exercises such as "putting oneself into another's shoes."
						Mental states are even more flexible than physical ones, so symmetry is even more challenging to find.  
						Consider states adjacent to the one that causes you tension- if you had an argument with someone, imagine having the same argument with your mother, or the pope.
						If something is worrying you, consider someone else worrying about the same problem - what would they feel and do?
						Or consider an adjacent problem - a smaller, simpler version, or a much greater one.  
						How would you handle those, and how can you apply that solution to your current situation?
					</p>

					<h4> Additional physical exercises</h4>
					<p>
						Symmetrizing in static positions against the force of gravity:
						Consider how a watchmaker regulates a watch in multiple positions, so should a person take various poses and align their entire energy structure symmetrically in that position, including breath and thinking. 
						The goal is, for example, if you are leaning down to pick something up, to use your legs as well as your arms as well as your back, so that your whole body becomes tense with the same intensity curve.
						These exercises require a high degree of sensitivity to our own body.  It may be difficult to tell whether the weight on one leg is different than the weight on the other.
						Practicing these exercises will improve our sensitivity to our own body and our awareness of the symmetry of our state.  
					</p>
					<h4>Example pose:</h4>
					<p>
						Standing straight, experience the difference in weight between both feet. 
						Bending your knees, putting your hands on them to relieve weight from your back. 
						Pose can progress down forearms until elbows are on knees. 
						Try to maintain a balanced level of stress across your body, adjusting the positions of the knees and neck, maintaining your breathing to match the intensity that your body experiences.
					</p>

					<h4>Static poses with isometric tension</h4>
					<p>
						The same as before, but instead of statically engaging muscles against the force of gravity, statically engage muscles against each other.
						This can be done laying down or in any other position.
					</p>
					<h4>Small oscillations around static poses</h4>
					<p>
						To help gain sensitivity, we can make small circles around static positions and notice how our feelings change throughout the movement.
						Oscillate one foot's weight into the toe, then back into the heel. Try the other foot, then both. Try the same but into the heels. Try the opposite between both. 

					</p>

					<h3> Dynamics </h3>

					<h4> Optimal Walking </h4>

					<p>
						What does it mean to walk optimally?
						The solution is somewhat straightforward:
						Consider the act of walking as a combination of a series of positions, each of which need to be maintained for a certain period of time.
						Each position is defined by a tensing and a releasing of a particular set of muscles.
						First of all, because of our innate physical left-right symmetry, it follows that the optimal solution for walking should be left-right symmetric.
						This means that the effort exerted during the left motions should be the same as for the right.
						Becoming aware of each position in the exercise, we can compare the symmetric opposite to realize where we are over-tensing and where we are too relaxed.
						For example, if we notice that throughout the entire left-right cycle, one part of our body remains tense while its opposite does not, we are doing something wrong.
						Similarly, in each position, we can become aware of the parts of our body that are tense and the ones that are relaxed.
						This can lead us to become aware of differences that are too great and need to be drawn together.
						For example, if we walk while looking down with a bent neck, perhaps at our phone, our neck will be relaxed while our shoulders become tense.
						Because our awareness is not necessarily symmetric, we may not realize how out of symmetry we have become, and may not realize how much tension we are holding onto.
						By tensing the parts that have been underworked and neglected, we can bring ourselves to complete balance.
						This will also help us start relaxing the parts that are constantly tense and overworked.
						
					</p>


					<h3> Intentional Tension</h3>

					<h4> Oscillating Down</h4>
					<p>
						Stress relief is only partially a reduction of tension in a particular area.  
						If our minds are tense, likely our necks or shoulders are also tense to support that exertion.
						Our focus draws our tension.
						When we feel over-loaded and we have passed our upper boundary of comfort, oscillating back down can be difficult.
						Telling ourselves to relax probably won't work, because that is again putting focus on the tense areas.
						Distractions tend to work better:  
						Focusing on sights, sounds, and other areas of the body are common techniques for relaxation.
						Intentionally changing our focus changes our internal tensions.  
						Changing our focus too quickly may lead to a disconnect

					</p>

					<h4> Oscilalting Up </h4>
					<p>
						The opposite of stress is depression.  
						There are at least as many people who suffer with some form of anxiety or stress as there are who suffer with deprepssion and inactivity.
						Often the two go hand in hand, as a lack of general symmetry causes one portion of a person's phase space to be depressed while another is overactive.
						Or, the waves of tension that course through them are too great, periodically overwhelming them and leaving them empty.
						If you are in a low energy state, the only solution is to create asymmetric tension.  
						Breathe deeply, then quickly.  Stand up, walk around, change your location and talk to someone.  
						Lose yourself in an activity, then find yourself in that activity again.

					</p>
					
					<h3> Generalizing Physical Structure</h3>

					<p> There are two processes at play in any attempt at symmetry - sensing and acting.  
						Scanning over your body (or other degrees of freedom), noticing relative tension differences.
						Then rotating (as rotating is all we can do), making small adjustments.
						Then scanning the same area again.  If balanced, scan a larger area.  If still imbalanced, try to repeat the process.

					<h3> Sensory Control Devices</h3>
					<p>
						I have the right to control what waves I consume. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Ears are the simplest- nose canceling headphones can be turned into nose control headphones: modulating all sounds into predefined ranges of volumes and frequencies.
						I may not want someone to have the ability to shock me with a scream as this could significantly alter my state.
						For some, the change is catastrophic and requires significant efforts to restore.   
						

					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly for the eyes it would be something like Adblock glasses. Sure there is a black mirror episode about it but the difference is individual control and intention.
						I have the right not not look at ads if I do not want to.  I can cover my eyes with rose glasses, but they are useful only inasmuch as they allow me to express my intention.
